# Prioritized Feature Implementation List

## High Priority (Pure Frontend, Easy to Implement)

1. **Search Functionality for Ingredients**
   - Add a search bar at the top of the fridge page
   - Filter the existing ingredients list based on user input
   - Implementation is straightforward using the existing FlatList component in fridge.tsx
   - No backend changes required, just local state management

2. **Visual Enhancements for Ingredients**
   - Add icons based on ingredient categories
   - Can be implemented with a mapping of ingredients to icons
   - Purely cosmetic change with no backend requirements

3. **Batch Operations**
   - Add multi-select functionality to the existing FridgeItem components
   - Implement batch delete button that appears when items are selected
   - All logic can be handled in the frontend

4. **Recipe Customization UI Enhancements**
   - Add toggle switches for "Ingredients ONLY" in recipe.tsx
   - Add UI for dietary restriction filters
   - These can be implemented as frontend filters applied before displaying recipes

5. **Simple Ingredient Categorization**
   - Implement a basic category tag system for ingredients
   - Add sorting/filtering by these categories
   - Can be done by extending the current item structure without major backend changes

## Medium Priority (Requires Some Backend Integration)

1. **Improved Recipe Filters**
   - Implementing cooking time and difficulty filters that work with the recipe generation
   - May require small backend adjustments to pass these parameters

2. **Recipe History**
   - Add a section to view previously generated recipes
   - Requires local storage implementation, but no significant backend changes

3. **Advanced Ingredient Categorization**
   - More sophisticated category management
   - May require backend adjustments for storing category information

## Lower Priority (Requires Significant Backend Changes)

1. **Expiration Date Tracking**
   - Would require backend schema changes to store dates
   - Need backend logic to prioritize items nearing expiration

2. **Shopping List Integration**
   - Requires additional API endpoints for managing shopping lists
   - Complex integration with existing ingredients system

3. **Quantity Suggestions**
   - Would require backend intelligence to provide appropriate quantity suggestions
