#### Who I am
Alexzendor Misra, 21, from bay area. Backend and full stack dev, also have experience with AI/ML. Worked for several startups, looking forward to making a cool app!

Have experience with Python, C++, Java, GCP, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Pytorch, Fastapi, Django, MongoDB, Redis, Nginx, etc.

Main weakness is front end, don't have much experience there, might need a bit of help with that lol.

#### Plans

1. app on electron for both web and mobile. Will need some sick design.
2. Social media esque design, image focused
- See comments, how people think of each recipie, ratings, etc
3. AI components, to generate recipies from scratch, or generate them based on a user's ingredient list/fridge
