## Action item
Goal: Better communication outside of class time<br />
Experiment: Daily check-ins on Slack/iMessages about the progress or blockers<br />
Measurement: Everyone has a similar understanding on where we are as a group. We can also all discuss how we feel about the progres and communication.<br />

## Retro Assessment
We used the Start/Stop/Continue process, and we believe it was quite effective. It allowed us to gain a clearer understanding of where each group member is facing challenges and where they're excelling. Many valuable points were raised during the discussion, and it was notable that several comments were similar across the team. This indicates that we share common concerns and recognize the same strengths within the group. One suggestion for the next retro leader would be to allocate more time for the "Stop" section. Teams often focus less on this compared to "Start" or "Continue," but diving deeper into what we should stop doing can be crucial for improving our workflow.
