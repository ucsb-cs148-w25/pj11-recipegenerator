# Date of Retrospective 02: 02/19/25

* Led by: Amber
* Present: Jiaqi Alex Andrew Amber Junjie Christy Shiyuan

## Start
- Coordinating code reviews before merging branches to maintain quality and consistency
- Scheduling short weekly design discussions to clarify new features and align on UI/UX changes
- Creating mini-guides or documentation for complex tasks

## Stop
- Delaying pull requests until the very end of the sprint—causing last-minute merges
- Spending too much time on minor styling details before core features are complete

## Continue
- Using the Kanban board to track tasks and stay aligned
- Regular check-ins in Slack/Discord to highlight blockers
- Collaboration on database and feature improvements (recipe ideas)

## Action Item
**Goal:** Improve code quality and reduce last-minute merge issues

**Experiment:** Have at least one reviewer per pull request before merging into the main branch.

**Measurement:** Fewer merge conflicts and hotfixes needed in the last week of the sprint.

# Retro Outcomes
We used a quick “Start / Stop / Continue” outline followed by an open discussion to identify successes, a goal, and a commitment for the upcoming sprint.

**Report**

- **Successes**:  
  1. Improved collaboration on Kanban board updates.  
  2. Daily check-ins helped resolve blockers faster.  
  3. New feature integrated smoothly.

- **A Goal**:  
  - Integrate code reviews earlier in the sprint to reduce last-minute merge conflicts.

- **A Commitment**:  
  - Each developer will request at least one teammate to review their pull request before merging.
