About me: I'm Christy Yu, I'm a Computer Science and Statistics & Data Science double major. I know Python, HTML/CSS/JS, R, and I have some experience with Java, C++, and React. 

Ideas for project: Either a web or mobile app, one where it is usable for people like me who have limited groceries but enjoy cooking. Being able to save or favorite recipes or share with friends would be a nice feature to add.
