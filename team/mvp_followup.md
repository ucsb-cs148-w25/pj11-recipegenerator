  - Ability to save recipes for later use.
  - Manual ingredient inventory tracking.
  - Ability to generate recipes using AI based on available ingredients.
  - Clean UI with easy navigation.
  - Guest login and manual input for ingredients.
- Suggestions for Improvement:
  - Incorporate spice/seasoning input and better handling of common ingredients (like salt, pepper, etc.).
  - Add options for specifying cuisine preferences (e.g., Asian, Italian).
  - Ability to select specific ingredients users don’t want in recipes (e.g., allergies, dislikes).
  - Include option to filter recipes based on serving sizes or portion control.
  - Ability to save and share recipes with friends.
  - Allow users to input missing ingredients for recommendations on substitutions.
  - Integrate user-generated content for recipe sharing.
  - Integrate features like selecting the desired cooking time or level of difficulty.
2. User Interface and Experience (UI/UX)
- Positive Feedback:
  - Clean, simple layout and intuitive navigation.
  - Easy updating of fridge inventory.
  - Fridge and saved recipes sections are helpful and well-received.
- Suggestions for Improvement:
  - Recipe instructions could be structured more clearly (better readability, step-by-step formatting).
  - Adjust UI elements for better accessibility (e.g., making icons like the "trash" and "plus" buttons larger for mobile use).
  - Add more visuals to recipes (e.g., recipe images or photos of completed dishes).
  - Potential to improve visual appearance of the home page and recipe display.
  - Clearer instructions on how to use the camera function for scanning ingredients.
3. AI & Recipe Generation
- Positive Feedback:
  - AI-generated recipes are creative and innovative, solving the problem of missing ingredients in traditional recipes.
  - Users appreciate the ability to generate unique recipes without needing to search for them manually.
- Suggestions for Improvement:
  - Ensure AI generates more realistic and appetizing recipes (some users reported unrealistic recipes, like "matcha chicken").
  - Incorporate a mechanism to filter out recipes that don't make sense or are strange combinations.
  - AI should allow for adjustments based on user preferences (flavor profiles, preferred cuisine, etc.).
  - Add a feature that detects allergens or problematic ingredients in recipes.
4. Additional Features and Enhancements
- Positive Feedback:
  - The fridge inventory and recipe generation process is well-received.
- Suggestions for Improvement:
  - Add a group feature for shared fridge inventories (for families/roommates).
  - Implement automatic updates to the fridge inventory once a recipe is made.
  - Introduce an option for users to rate and comment on generated recipes.
  - Integrate utensil selection so that recipes are better suited to available kitchen tools (e.g., no need for a fryer if the user doesn’t own one).
  - Include a filter option based on recipe complexity or time constraints.
  - Add a recipe sharing function so users can send recipes they like to others.


# Response Actions
1. Recipe Generation and AI
- Train AI models to improve recipe quality and reduce unrealistic results.
- Add user-controlled filters, such as cuisine type, ingredient exclusions (allergies), and portion size.
- Allow users to specify additional preferences like flavor profiles or time constraints for recipes.
2. UI/UX Improvements
- Redesign the home page and recipe layout to make it more visually appealing and less text-heavy.
- Enhance recipe step formatting to make instructions clearer and more accessible, especially for beginner cooks.
- Make the "trash" and "plus" buttons larger for mobile usability.
- Integrate recipe images or pictures to help users visualize dishes.
3. Additional Features
- Implement a way for users to save, rate, and share recipes.
- Introduce the ability to create a shared fridge inventory for groups, such as families or roommates.
- Enable an option to filter recipes based on available cooking tools (e.g., not suggesting deep-fry recipes if the user doesn’t have a fryer).
4. Handling Ingredients and Allergies
- Implement an allergy section that identifies problematic ingredients in the generated recipes.
- Allow users to specify items they don't have, and generate recipes with only a small number of missing ingredients.
5. Optimization of the Image Upload Process
- Work on enhancing the AI model to better handle image recognition for ingredients.
- Add functionality for verifying and correcting ingredients identified through the image upload feature.




# Next Steps
1. UI/UX Enhancements
- Prioritize user interface adjustments based on feedback (larger buttons, clearer recipe formatting, adding images for recipes).
- Begin working on adding a filter for recipe types (e.g., cuisine, cooking time, difficulty).
2. AI Improvements
- Refine AI’s recipe suggestions to ensure they are realistic and appetizing by fine-tuning the dataset.
- Introduce a way for users to input missing ingredients and receive recipe recommendations with those substitutions.
3. Feature Development
- Develop the ability for users to rate, save, and share their favorite recipes with others.
- Work on group fridge functionality for shared inventories.
4. Testing and Feedback
- Conduct user testing to ensure that the new features meet expectations, particularly in areas like AI reliability, recipe accuracy, and UI improvements.
- Collect additional user feedback on the updated features to ensure continued improvement.
5. Launch
- Plan for a phased launch of the updated app with enhanced functionality and design.
- Prepare marketing materials to highlight new features such as shared fridge inventories, recipe sharing, and improved UI/UX.
