# Team Evaluation Response Report

## 1. Feedback Based on USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md
### Summary of Feedback:
- The generated recipes generally align with user expectations, however some unrealistic recipes appear with limited ingredient inputs.
- The ingredient selection process is intuitive, but it would be helpful to allow users to specify more options for recipe generation (e.g., filters for cuisine type, dietary restrictions, and available appliances).
- Users appreciated the ability to save and share recipes.

### Team Response:
- We will refine our AI model to ensure more realistic recipe suggestions when limited ingredients are provided.
- We will implement additional filters to let users customize recipe generation based on dietary preferences and appliance availability.
- We will ensure the save and share functionality remains robust and consider adding ways to categorize saved recipes.
