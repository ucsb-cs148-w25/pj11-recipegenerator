# User Feedback Needs

## Priority Areas for Feedback

For the upcoming Inter-Team Evaluation on **02/26/25**, we would like to gather feedback on the following aspects of our product. These feedback points are listed in order of priority:

### 1. **AI Recipe Generation Quality & Realism**
   - **Feedback Focus**: How realistic and appetizing are the AI-generated recipes?
   - **Specific Questions**:
     - Are the ingredient combinations logical and appealing?
     - Do the generated recipes match the userâ€™s expectations based on available ingredients?
     - Are there any unusual or unrealistic recipe suggestions (e.g., "matcha chicken")?
   - **Proposed Evaluation Method**:
     - Provide evaluators with a set of sample fridge inventories and ask them to assess the AI-generated recipes.
     - Collect qualitative feedback on what they find useful, strange, or in need of improvement.

### 2. **User Interface & Experience (UI/UX) Improvements**
   - **Feedback Focus**: Clarity, accessibility, and ease of navigation.
   - **Specific Questions**:
     - Is the home page visually appealing and easy to navigate?
     - Are recipe instructions structured clearly (step-by-step formatting, readability)?
     - Are UI elements (buttons, icons) appropriately sized and positioned for mobile users?
     - Do users understand how to use the photo upload feature for ingredient scanning?
   - **Proposed Evaluation Method**:
     - Have evaluators navigate the app and complete tasks such as adding ingredients, generating recipes, and saving recipes.
     - Gather feedback on usability, clarity of instructions, and any confusion they experience.

### 3. **Filtering & Customization Options for Recipe Preferences**
   - **Feedback Focus**: Ability to tailor recipes to user preferences.
   - **Specific Questions**:
     - How intuitive is it to exclude specific ingredients (e.g., allergies, dislikes)?
     - Is it easy to set cuisine preferences (e.g., Asian, Italian, Vegan)?
     - Would users find it useful to filter recipes by cooking time or difficulty level?
   - **Proposed Evaluation Method**:
     - Have evaluators attempt to filter recipes based on preferences (e.g., exclude a disliked ingredient, choose a cuisine type, or select an easy recipe).
     - Collect feedback on whether these features are intuitive and effective.

## Next Steps
- Prepare a functional deployment of the app with the latest improvements for the Inter-Team Evaluation.
- Ensure that feedback collection mechanisms (e.g., surveys, forms) are set up to record evaluator responses.
- Analyze feedback post-evaluation and prioritize necessary refinements based on user input.
