# About me
Name: Shiyuan Wang

# Project Idea:
I believe we should adapt electron as the base of our projcet as it has great cross-platform compatibility. WIth electron, we can create a desktop application that can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux. This will allow us to reach a wider audience and make our project more accessible. Additionally, electron is built on top of node.js and chromium, which means we can use also build mobile applications using the same codebase. This will save us time and resources as we can reuse the same code for multiple platforms.
