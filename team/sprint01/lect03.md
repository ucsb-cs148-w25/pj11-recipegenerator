Today we went over our MVP features and features that we want to add later. Features we will be working on for MVP includes: 

For backend:
1. Auth (Google OAuth)
2. MongoDB storage structure
3. Endpoints:
- Takes in list of ingredients, returns multiple recipes
- Takes in input (ingredients in the fridge), stores them in MongoDB
- Sends user fridge content from MongoDB to frontend
- When a user selects a recipe, store it in the “history”, and remove its ingredients from the fridge

For frontend:
- Login Page
- Homepage allows options for 
- 1. Fridge Page

- 3. We can add this later: profile page
