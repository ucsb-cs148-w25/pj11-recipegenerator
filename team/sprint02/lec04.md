Scribed Discussion:

Today each of us provided an update on our progress. We are working to link our frotnend design to backend functionalities.

For backend:

Auth (Google OAuth)
MongoDB storage structure
Endpoints:
Takes in list of ingredients, returns multiple recipes
Takes in input (ingredients in the fridge), stores them in MongoDB
Sends user fridge content from MongoDB to frontend
When a user selects a recipe, store it in the “history”, and remove its ingredients from the fridge
For frontend:

Login Page
Done: demo app; wensite interface
todo: actual sign-in system
We can add this later: profile page
